Order API demo

This application was developed using hexagonal architecture to isolate the core domain from the application and configuration.<br>
If you pay attention the beans were configurated manually without annotations just to isolate the business domain logic from configuration.
<br><br>
The class diagram was developed using simple logic, otherwise the complexity would increase.

# Instructions to run the application:
Java 1.8 <br>
Lombok
